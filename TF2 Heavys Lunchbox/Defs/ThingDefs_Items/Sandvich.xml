		<description>This is the Vegetarian Sandvich Edible Device, or "Sandvich" for short. It is a great tool for a Pawn defending an area, as it gives him the ability to replenish health between enemy waves. First deployed in Old Earth warfare approximately three thousand five hundred years ago, the dish has served for centuries as an invaluable life saver. Mercenaries in particular treasure it. \n \n This delicacy has a phenomenal healing effect to those who consume it. A proper Sandvich cannot be made with just any meat: potted meat spread, canned and smeared onto the bread, gives that extra special flavor that makes its consumer delighted! Its medical potency exceeds that of mere Herbal Medicine.</description>
