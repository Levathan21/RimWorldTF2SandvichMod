    <description>This is the sandvich. The Sandvich acts like medicine since in TF2 when eaten it restores 300 health so i decided to replicate that by making it slightly better then herbal meds. This version replaces the meat with extra of the plant/animal product ingredents. Note the cheese quality dose not matter even the worst cheese will work. Simply dont waste your legendery quality cheese on this</description>
