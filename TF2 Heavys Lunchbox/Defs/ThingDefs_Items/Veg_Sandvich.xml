<!-- The Sandvich acts like medicine since in TF2 when eaten it restores 300 health so i decided to replicate that by making it slightly better then herbal meds. This version replaces the meat with extra of the plant/animal product ingredents. Note the cheese quality dose not matter even the worst cheese will work. Simply dont waste your legendery quality cheese on this -->

		<description>This is the Vegetarian Sandvich Edible Device, or "Sandvich" for short. It is a great tool for a Pawn defending an area, as it gives him the ability to replenish health between enemy waves. First deployed in Old Earth warfare approximately three thousand five hundred years ago, the dish has served for centuries as an invaluable life saver. Mercenaries in particular treasure it. \n \n This vegetarian delicacy has a phenomenal healing effect to those who consume it. A Sandvich made without meat costs consistently more produce to produce, but its medical potency exceeds that of mere Herbal Medicine.</description>
